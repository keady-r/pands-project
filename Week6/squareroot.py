#Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
# You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
#I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).
#This is to demonstrate that you can research and code a process (If you really needed the square root you would use one of the above methods).
#I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots.
#This is a more difficult task than some of the others, but will be marked equally, so only do as much work on this as you feel comfortable
