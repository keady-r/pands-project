Introductoion:

The infamous Iris Fisher's data is a well studied statistical chain and pattern recognistion dataseet that studies variables within three species of flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each species has four variables those being : Petal length (cm), Petal Width (cm), Sepal length (cm), and Sepal Width (cm). The dataset comprises of 50 cases for each variable [1,2,3]. 

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher is accredited with the development adn discovery of the Iris Fisher's dataset [3]. His goal was to identify a discriminant analysis i.e. to produce a simple function that, given the four measurements, will classify a flower correctly [4]. From Fisher's data, it can be concluded that if the Iris flower has a sepal and petal lengths of 6-8cm and 5-7cm respectively and a petal width of 1.5-2.5cm, it can be concluded that that Iris has a high probability of being an IrisVirginica. On the other hand,  if the Iris flower has a shorter sepal and petal length of 4.5-5.5cm and 1-2cm respectively and narrow 
 petals of 0.1-.5cm this Iris flower is most likely an Iris-Setosa. An Iris flower that lies between these two parameters is most probably an Iris-Versicolor. [4] 

The success of this dataset is attributed to the fact that it can be implecated into a large variety of statistical analyses. 


The aim of this project was to incorporate all the learnings from the lectures through week 1-13 to show as much of an understanding of the code. I aimed to cover all the asks of the project 1) extract data into file  2) Create histograms 3) scatter plots 4) additional analysis but also make the code suitable for end user use - I tried to imiage how this code could be used in a system. In alot of the cases I've added check-points or input options so that the code does not run all at once - this was intentional to create an end user interface and also to explore new options and chalenge my ability.
