**Title: Pands Project 2022 – Submitted for assessment. An analysis of the Iris Dataset using python. **

Introduction: 

The famous Iris Fisher's data is a well-studied statistical chain and pattern recognition dataset that studies variables within three species of Iris flowers: I. setosa, I. versicolor, and I. virginica. Each species has four variables, those being: Petal length (cm), Petal Width (cm), Sepal length (cm), and Sepal Width (cm). The dataset comprises of 50 cases for each species of Iris [1,2,3].  

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher is accredited with the development and discovery of the Iris Fisher's dataset [3]. His goal was to identify a discriminant analysis i.e., to produce a simple function that, given the four measurements, will classify a flower correctly [4]. From Fisher's data, it can be concluded that if the Iris flower has a sepal and petal lengths of 6-8cm and 5-7cm respectively and a petal width of 1.5-2.5cm, the  Iris flower has a high probability of being an I. Virginica. On the other hand, if the Iris flower has a shorter sepal and petal length of 4.5-5.5cm and 1-2cm respectively and narrow petals of 0.1-.5cm this Iris flower is likely an Iris-Setosa. An Iris flower that lies between these two parameters is most probably an Iris-Versicolor. [4]  

The success of this dataset is attributed to the fact that it can be implicated in a large variety of statistical analyses and algorithm development. It is often used in data mining and data characterization. [5,6] 

On a basic level the aim of the project was to cover all the asks set out in the project description, those being:  

 1) Extract data into a txt file  

2) Create histograms  

3) scatter plots  

4) additional analysis  

To add to the challenge, I also aimed to make the code suitable for end user use - I tried to imagine how this code could be used in a system. In a lot of cases I added check-points or input options so that the code does not run all at once - this was intentional to create an end user interface and also to explore new options and challenge my ability. 

I also aimed to incorporate all topics from the lectures (weeks 1-13) into the code to show as much of an understanding of the code discussed within the course – reference to each lecture is given in the analysis.py file.  

I really enjoyed the project and have gained a much greater knowledge of how to implicate python. I ran into several challenges, all noted within the script however through troubleshooting I was able to achieve an end result that meets the aims that I set out with for the project.
